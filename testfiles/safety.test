Two recent incidents  have uncovered a previously unknown phenomenon of
the most serious gravity.

1.  At Duquesne Electric a worker  threw  an  electrical  switch into a
    closed position, which produced a short-lived electrical spark.

2.  An employee at UPS flipped open the colored lense  of  his  welding
    helmet to better position the welding rod.  He inadvertently struck
    the metal rod to be welded producing an electric arc.

BOTH MEN WERE  WEARING  CONTACT LENSES.  Upon returning home from work,
they removed the contact lenses, and  THE CORNEA OF THE EYE WAS REMOVED
ALONG WITH THE LENS.  RESULT: PERMANENT BLINDNESS!!!
